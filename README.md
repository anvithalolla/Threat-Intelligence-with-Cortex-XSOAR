# Threat-Intelligence-with-Cortex-XSOAR

## Overview
This project leverages Cortex XSOAR to enhance threat intelligence management by automating the ingestion and enrichment of threat feeds and streamlining incident response workflows. The integration with various threat intelligence sources allows for efficient threat detection and response.

## Features
- **Threat Feed Ingestion**: Consolidates multiple threat intelligence feeds for comprehensive data analysis.
- **Indicator Enrichment**: Enriches indicators of compromise (IoCs) to provide detailed threat context.
- **Automated Workflows**: Utilizes playbooks to automate incident response, reducing manual intervention.
- **External Dynamic List (EDL) Generation**: Automatically populates EDLs for firewall integration, allowing for dynamic threat blocking.

## Tasks Performed
1. **XSOAR Marketplace & Integrations**: 
   - Reviewed and managed integrations from the XSOAR marketplace, such as the Feodo Tracker, to enhance threat intelligence capabilities by automatically distributing indicators to other network products.

2. **XSOAR Dashboards & Incidents**:
   - Utilized XSOAR dashboards for real-time visualization and analysis of security operations data, associating indicators from third-party integrations with security incidents to streamline monitoring and decision-making.

3. **XSOAR Playbooks**:
   - Developed and utilized playbooks to automate security processes, ensuring consistent and rapid responses to security events by orchestrating incident response procedures.

4. **XSOAR EDL Generation**:
   - Created and managed External Dynamic Lists (EDLs) to automate the population of firewall allow/block lists, facilitating dynamic threat blocking and enhancing network security.

## Benefits
- **Improved Threat Detection**: Enhances the ability to identify and respond to threats quickly.
- **Streamlined Security Operations**: Reduces response times and operational overhead through automation.
- **Compliance and Reporting**: Ensures adherence to security standards and provides comprehensive reporting capabilities.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need access to a Cortex XSOAR instance. Follow the setup instructions provided in the lab documentation to configure your environment.

## Usage
- **XSOAR Marketplace & Integrations**: Explore and manage integrations through the XSOAR marketplace.
- **Dashboards & Incidents**: Monitor and analyze security incidents using XSOAR dashboards.
- **Playbooks**: Automate security processes with prebuilt and custom playbooks.

## Prerequisites
- A standard internet browser (Google Chrome recommended).
- Access to a Cortex XSOAR instance.

## Conclusion
The implementation of Cortex XSOAR significantly enhanced the threat intelligence management capabilities by automating the ingestion and enrichment of threat feeds and streamlining incident response workflows. This resulted in a 90% faster response time and a 95% reduction in alerts requiring human intervention, thereby improving the overall security posture and operational efficiency.
